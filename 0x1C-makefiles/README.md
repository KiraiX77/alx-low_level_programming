ALX PROJECT makefiles
Overview
This repository contains CMakeFiles that facilitate the build process for a project. CMake is a cross-platform build system generator that simplifies the process of compiling, configuring, and managing the build environment for software projects.

Purpose
The CMakeFiles serve the following purposes:

Build Configuration: Define how the project should be built, including compiler options, linker settings, and project structure.
Platform Independence: Enable building on different platforms without modifying the build scripts extensively.
Dependency Management: Manage external libraries and dependencies required by the project.
Modularity: Organize the project into smaller, manageable components and libraries.
Directory Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:

src/: Contains the project's source code files.
include/: Contains header files used in the project.
CMakeLists.txt: Main CMake configuration file.
lib/: Directory for additional libraries or dependencies.
tests/: Directory for project test suites or unit tests.
docs/: Documentation related to the project.
